# Amazon Price Webscraper

This Python script allows you to scrape Amazon and scan if a specified item is below the defined low price point. 
If it is, the script sends you an email automatically, notifying you of the price. 
It allows you to save money on the purchase and time on the automated price checking.

## Features

- Fetch the price of the item on Amazon.
- Compare it to the defined low price point.
- Send an email notification if below.

## Setup

1. **Install Required Python Packages**

    Before running the script, you need to install the required Python libraries.

2. **SMTP API Credentials**

    Provide your email credentials to initiate SMTP. You can generate a password specifically for scripts from your gmail settings.


## Comments

Currently, you have to manually check camelcamelcamel for the low price point. Future versions of the script could automatically store the data of the specified item for its price, further automating the process.
